safe settings? - default (dynamically calculated by aws)

recommended settings?

1. shared_buffers
-Set to a reasonable fraction of available memory, typically 25% to 40% of total system memory.
-For AWS RDS PostgreSQL, this is automatically managed based on instance class and allocated memory.

2. work_mem
-Set to a size sufficient for sorting and hash joins.
-Start with a low value (e.g., 4MB) and increase as needed based on query requirements and available memory.

3. maintenance_work_mem
-Set to a size sufficient for maintenance operations like VACUUM, ANALYZE, and index creation.
-Start with a moderate value (e.g., 128MB to 1GB) depending on your database size and workload.

4. effective_cache_size
-Set to a size representing the available disk cache, typically 50% to 75% of total system memory.
-Helps PostgreSQL's query planner estimate the cost of accessing data pages.

5. checkpoint_completion_target
-Adjust between 0.5 to 0.9 to balance checkpoint completion time and throughput.
-Higher values can reduce I/O spikes during checkpoints but might prolong checkpoint completion.

6. max_connections
-Set to a value based on expected concurrent connections and system resources.
-AWS RDS PostgreSQL has a default limit that varies by instance type.

7. autovacuum
-Ensure autovacuum is enabled (autovacuum = on) to manage table and index vacuuming automatically.
-Adjust autovacuum settings (autovacuum_max_workers, autovacuum_naptime, etc.) based on workload and database size.

8. random_page_cost and seq_page_cost
-Adjust based on your storage characteristics (SSD vs. HDD).
-For SSDs, random_page_cost can be lowered to around 1.1, and seq_page_cost to 1.0.

9. temp_buffers
-Set to a size appropriate for temporary data storage in memory.
-Start with a low value (e.g., 8MB) and adjust based on temporary table usage.

10. max_wal_size and min_wal_size
-Set max_wal_size to a size sufficient for retaining WAL (Write-Ahead Log) segments.
-Adjust min_wal_size to control the minimum size of the WAL segment.
